## LAB 1
Content Assistant: 

A swift mobile app (or TJ Bot) might become a chatbot - a robot content assistant for picture search - 
ask verbally the app (or TJ BOT) for a picture - then the chatbot would search the Cloudinary API for images, 
and post links to pictures - you can choose the picture for your article:   
"Search for San Francisco"  "Add mono filter" "add square transformation"   "Show me a bay bridge in San Francisco."
The app would post the image links to Slack channel to manipulate the links to images.
