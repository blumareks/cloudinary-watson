**Best practices for custom classifiers in Watson Visual Recognition**
https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/10/watson-visual-recognition-training-best-practices/

**More Images = Better Accuracy**
The API will accept as few as 10 per class, but we strongly recommend using a significantly greater amount of images to improve the performance and accuracy of your classifier such as 100s or 1000s of images.

**Consider a Smart Media Asset Management workflow**
Consider how you're going to manage your digtal assets upfront.
Manage your assets in the cloud with an online Digital Asset Manager like [Cloudinary.com](http://www.Cloudinary.com) where you have a workflow solution that allows you to upload, categorize and tag your media in one place, then transform and deliver in a variety of formats to your AI ingestion pipeline.

**Consider video capture and cropping multiple subjects from your media**
Use API's to capture and crop and transform your media resources into multiple instances only when you need them.

Example: Upload a video and capture several frames of video simply by setting the start time, and file extension.

**Consider Youtube and Social Media Sites as sources for training images.**
Our API's and upload widget supports, YouTube, Facebook, Google Image Search, Instagram, and other social media sites out of the box.

Use multiple AI services to complement your image tagging.
Out of the box, Cloudinary supports image tagging, facial recognition, color detection, meta-data and adds support from multiple vendors, and with our APIS,  you can bolt on any AI service.    A simple server-less endpoint can pull it all together.
